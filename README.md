# Trident-Development-Kit
This folder contains information useful for interfacing external designs with the Trident ROV

The FreeCAD and STL files are tracked using Git-LFS for large file storage.
See https://git-lfs.github.com/ for details on installing and working with Git-LFS.

This isn't a particularly elegant "fork" in the traditional sense because GitHub does not
properly support adding git-lfs to public forks. For details, see the following issue:
